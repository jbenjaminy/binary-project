* What is 2^5 in binary?

    32 / 2 = 16 (r.0)
    16 / 2 = 8 (r.0)
    8 / 2 = 4 (r.0)
    4 / 2 = 2 (r.0)
    2 / 2 = 1 (r.0)
    1 / 2 = 0 (r.1)

    [1]*2^(5) => 32 => 2^(5)

* What is 2^5 - 1 in binary?

    31 / 2 = 15 (r.1)
    15 / 2 = 7 (r.1)
    7 / 2 = 3 (r.1)
    3 / 2 = 1 (r.1)
    1 / 2 = 0 (r.1)

    ([1]*1^(0) = 1) + ([1]*2^(1) = 2) + ([1]*2^(2) = 4) + ([1]*2^(3) = 8) + ([1]*2^(4) = 16) => 31 => 2^(5) - 1

* What is the general rule for binary numbers which are or the form 2^n or 2^n - 1?

    -For 2^n you would just have a '1' in position 'n'.
    -For 2^n - 1 you would have '1s' for every position before 'n'.
